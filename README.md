Projects and Works

Project 1 - [Credit Card Fraud Detection Analysis](https://github.com/HarrisonJYU/DS_project/blob/working/credit_card_fraud_detection/credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb)
- Built a Neural Network to detect credit card fraud activity with Scikit-learn and Keras, achieving 97% AUC 
- Preprocessed over 250k credit card data with 30 features, deployed multiple methods to handle data imbalance 
- Implemented other classic ML algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest and SGD, and benchmarked with baseline Neural Network model in terms of performance and computation time
