# Harrison's Portfolio
Selected Projects and Works

<b>**Data Science**</b>

Project 1 - [Credit Card Fraud Detection Analysis](https://github.com/HarrisonJYU/DS_project/blob/working/credit_card_fraud_detection/credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb)
- Built a Neural Network to detect credit card fraud activity with Scikit-learn and Keras, achieving 97% AUC 
- Preprocessed over 250k credit card data with 30 features, deployed multiple methods to handle data imbalance 
- Implemented other classic ML algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest and SGD, and benchmarked with baseline Neural Network model in terms of performance and computation time

Project 2 - [E-Commerce Conversion Rate Improvement Analysis](https://github.com/HarrisonJYU/DS_project/tree/main/improve_conversion)
- Built a classification model to gain insights and to improve conversion rate for an E-commerce site 
- Loaded over 300k user characteristics data who hit the site and created graphs to visualize key continuous and discrete features including age, new user and source using Matplotlib
- Trained Random Forest classifier to predict conversion rate, achieving 97% accuracy, and evaluated feature importances using partial dependence plot
